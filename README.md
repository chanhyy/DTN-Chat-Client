# DTN Chat Client

The DTN Chat Client is a terminal-based implementation of DTN (Delay-tolerant Networking)
that enables communication with other peers in a delay-tolerant network. Such applications are
particularly valuable in environments that are prone to disruptions, where traditional
communication infrastructures may not function efficiently or at all.

## Features

- Real-time display of peers 🤝
- ... and their states (Near/Away) 🟢🔴
- Scrollable chat log ✨
- Notification of unread incoming messages 📨
